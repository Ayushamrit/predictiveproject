# predictiveproject
•	Analyzed consumer spending data (income, savings, and expense categories) to identify patterns in financial behavior.
•	Built regression models (Linear, Polynomial, Random Forest) to predict miscellaneous expenses and evaluated them using MSE, MAE, and R².
•	Developed binary classification models to predict high savers using Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM.
•	Implemented multi-class classification to predict the primary spending category and compared model performance using confusion matrices.
•	Performed data preprocessing, correlation analysis, and visualization to support insights and model interpretation.
